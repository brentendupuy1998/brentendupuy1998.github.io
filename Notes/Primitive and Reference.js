// Primitive and Reference Values
// JavaScript provides six primitive types as undefined, null, boolean, number, string, and symbol.
// Reference type is object

// Primitive Value
// When you manipulate the value, you are working on the actual value stored in the variable. 
// The variable that stores a primitive value is accessed by value

// Reference: A variable that stores an object is accessed by reference.
